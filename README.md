Main dev from ESA - Enhanced Stream Alerts: A way to easily create advanced alerts for your stream.
Please Note: ESA is not yet publicly available.

**What exactly is ESA planned to be?**

ESA is developed to be an easy way to implement common events (like follows)
and rather uncommon events (like switching songs in spotify) in to your stream. 

It's design allows you to customize said alerts in a very extended but simple way.
For example from simple things like fonts or background images to more crazy stuff
like background and text animations that can respond to specific events like 
someone follows right as the next song starts to play.
