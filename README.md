Main dev from ESA - Enhanced Stream Alerts: A way to easily create advanced alerts for your stream.

**What exactly is ESA?**

ESA is developed to be an easy way to implement common events (like follows)
and rather uncommon events (like switching songs in spotify) in to your stream. 

It is desinged to allow you to customize said alerts in a very extended way.
For example from simple things like fonts or background images to more crazy stuff
like background and text animations that can respond to specific events like 
someone follows right as the next song starts to play.
